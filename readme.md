1 GPT 与 GPT-2 模型的差别就在于 GPT-2 使用了更多的训练数据，增加了模型参数，在具体结构上并无较大差异。

2 BERT 是基于双向 Transformer 结构构建，而 GPT-2 是基于单向 Transformer，这里的双向与单向，是指在进行注意力计算时，BERT会同时考虑被遮蔽词左右的词对其的影响，而 GPT-2 只会考虑在待预测词位置左侧的词对待预测词的影响。

3 GPT-2 就是一个语言模型，能够根据上文预测下一个单词，所以它就可以利用预训练已经学到的知识来生成文本，如生成新闻。也可以使用另一些数据进行微调，生成有特定格式或者主题的文本，如诗歌、戏剧。

4 本模型是通过预训练模型，输入"guobing, you are so fat"，得到：guobing, you are so fat, that it takes a bit. So, I am very lucky that this year has had this big and wonderful opportunity, which means so I can take the risk with you." The first few hours on the bike are hard and hard but the second is just too long so it doesn`nt feel like there has even been anything on. "When a big mountain is coming to a place, we need to go. We don `d go out with no bikes at the top, we just want it there。

5 再通过138150字的戏剧文本《罗密欧与朱丽叶》进行微调，再次输入"guobing, you are so fat"，得到：guobing, you are so fat, O me. Come now to my chamber; where is Romeo to lie! O Juliet--Hush; she will give thee her rest: go to Montag: O Montignac; there lies Romeo. O mad Juliet, what art's her here-- Where art these poor little friars? 'Alas!' quears the friAR! I see you must have an eye, O Romeo; I see that Juliet bears such fruit, O mad Paris!' Come! what an ill humour this Romeo wakes you! Come thou now hither: come I now, nurse-- O, my head is heavy--Come now; come hither again:' Come thou again: come, go! ' CAPulete cries out again--CAPULEt Where have the Montserrel come to die? come now again, and stay: Juliet, I must kill myself --I'll, kill you all--but, my heart--Go. Juliet rushes in: Juliet cries And comes, O good nurse. 'Come now! my heart!' and 'O happy day is upon her; go to her. I see--she will look after thee,-- Herself, my love--'Ah! what is her name again'?--Hail me, Romeo!' O Juliet,' say ye: I am so ill-wisher--'Al as ill! O my head--I must die!' I am gone--I come again. What is Romeo--Ah, mad Montagueso!--O Juliet, My Romeo's man--What an aeeling wag thou shalt see: Romeo!' 'Come now: look thou back:' and I come! Juliet comes: Ah!' Ah,' what! Romeo is in his shroud!-- I say--here he be: come forth and kill the man: O! what, my son!' CAPUMEAUUE falls Nurse? what a wretch are yoked in! JUNE JULIS is in heaven,--Nursed, Hence the earth tremans and throws forth her fiery wings like lightning To pounce forth her holy fiery wheels to rip down our saintful and delectated idol. I am Romeo!' What dut'er art thou there Where I once saw so fair, That with thy help she may make thee an everlasting saint? O! my child--I have known this child since childhood, my。可以看出，得到的结果就是类似于戏剧文本。
